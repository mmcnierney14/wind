Problems:

1) Applying forces (Does the applied force reevaluate at every instance?)
					(Does the direction really work?)
2) How can we employ linear damping to emulate friction?
3) How can we use a conversion rate to use metric units?
4) How can make the wind act on the center of the boat, not its top left corner?
